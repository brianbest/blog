					<h1 class="title">LIFE IS STRANGE</h1>
					<p>I’ve been a fan of saying that video games are the next level of storytelling for humanity. Much like how writing, art, song and movies started from humble, and in ways archaic, beginnings came before the interactive narrative is really something that has come a long way and really matured in the past few years.</p>

					<p>Indigo Prophecy was a game I picked up on the PS2 back sometime in the 00’s, It’s was my first game that I played that really felt like i was an actor in a film rather than a hero in a game. The story was dark and more drawn out with characters that had long arcs and most of all my choices really mattered to the narrative.</p>

					<p>Years later I’ve played more games that encapsulated rich narratives like Mass Effect and Gone Home and have really carried those experiences with me more than any book or movie, just due to the fact that i was an active participant in the story.</p>

					<p>Enter Life Is Strange, a game from publisher Square Enix and developed by Dontnod Entertainment. It is an episodic game with 5 chapters. By episodic I mean the game is broken into chunks you only buy one chapter at a time in this case each episode is about $5 or you can by all the episodes for $16. While not a unique mode to market, TellTail games became quite famous for their episodic game based around the Walking Dead franchise, it is quite the ingenious way to make a profit in the video game space.</p>

					<p>Typically people I find that people are really polarized with narrative based games… to the point where some gamers question the very need to even have development “wasted” on them… However episodic games offer a really cunning way to get even those folks on board.</p>

					<p>I wont spoil much about the plot of Life Is Strange, as I believe its best to experience it. You play Maxine Caulfield, a photography student who discovers that she has the ability to rewind time at any moment, leading her every choice to enact the butterfly effect. The story is told in a fantastic way with the mechanic of rewinding time as a way to deepen the experience. The first episode is only 5 bucks and I literally had my jaw on the floor by the end of it. Its hard not to throw money at Dontnod to find out what’s next in this story.</p>

					<p>A good story can keep you coming back for more and more and thats the beauty of episodic game play Square Enix will be getting my $16 bucks because I love this game. But even for those who just want to try a game like this, the barrier to entry is really low for them to come and try it out. If they hate it then they’ve only lost 5 bucks rather then the $70 most AAA games charge.</p>
